                  <p>I have seen numerous videos of content creators lamenting how hard it is to get monetizedâ€“ and for those who are now monetized, some didn't find it easy.</p>
                  <p>One step to get monetized on YouTube is to have the required number of subscribers, which should be not less than 1,000, and 4,000 view hours in the last 365 days.</p>
                  <p>However, for upcoming YouTube content creators, this feels unachievable. In this article, I will be sharing how to start a YouTube channel and get monetized in just 10 days.</p>
                  <p>Let's go!</p>
                  <strong>HOW TO GET MONETIZED IN 10 DAYS</strong>
                  <strong>NICHE</strong>
                  <p>Before you start a YouTube channel, make sure you have a niche. Your choice of niche could come from your passion or interest.</p>
                  <p>This could be in beauty, fashion, sports, or food. For example, if you pick a niche in sports, you need to narrow it down and pick what you can access valuable information on and are very passionate about.</p>
                  <p>When that area is solved, research it and make sure it has an audience.</p>
                  <p>This process would accelerate your monetization process.</p>
                  <strong>CONTENT STRATEGY</strong>
                  <p>After getting your niche figured out, the next step is to start creating unique and quality content.</p>
                  <p>Creating quality content that will fetch 4,000 watch hours in the shortest time is the aim here. To achieve this with unique and quality content, follow these simple steps:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Go to other popular vlog channels in your area of interest.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate and find an important loophole or missing information.</li>
                    <li>After finding this, go ahead and create amazing content with it.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><strong>BONUS:</strong>Make use of a content calendar to keep up with updating your viewers consistently and avoid creative blocks.</p>
                  <strong>VALUE</strong>	
                   <ul>
                        <li>Make content in your niche that solves a problem, go straight to the point, and avoid clickbait.</li>
                        <li>Your introduction should have your audience interested in seeing the other parts of your content.</li>
                        <li>It is advised to make catchy headlines but avoid clickbait since it can leave your audience disappointed when they find your content entirely different from what the thumbnail says.</li>
                        <li>Remember, the aim is to get viewers to subscribe and not otherwise.</li>
                   </ul>
                  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>Be confident about your findings, and by doing so, you will come off as an expert.</p>
                   <strong>STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE ON HOW TO APPLY FOR MONETIZATION</strong>
                   <p>The next step is monetization after successfully gaining 4,000 public watch hours and 1,000 subscribers. Follow the guide below:</p>
                   <ol>
                        <li>Open your 'YouTube Studio app' and go to the menu on the left.</li>
                        <li>Search for 'monetization' and click.</li>
                        <li>The YouTube Partner Program will appear; agree to its terms and conditions.</li>
                        <li>Next, set up an AdSense account and link it to your channel.</li>
                   </ol>
                  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>Before applying for monetization on YouTube, go through the list of eligible countries to see if you are eligible.</p>	
                   <p>However, the YouTube Partnership Program is not the only avenue to earn money on the app. You can explore routes like content sponsorship, etc.</p>
                  
                  <strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
                  <p>Giving value to your subscribers is what makes you stand out from many content creators. It could even get your channel monetized faster than you think.</p>
                  <p>Yes! Some people have gotten monetized in just seven days, so this could be your ticket.</p>

                      <p>Freelancing has become increasingly popular, even though it has been in existence for a long time. In a world of 8.2 billion people, freelancers around the planet have been estimated to number around 1.54 billion, according to Statista.</p>
                        <p>It's no secret that once you're in this industry, you're in charge of everything you do, from scheduling your day to fixing appointments. In this article, I will be sharing five unique apps that aid your daily life, from time management to receiving payment.</p>
                        <strong>1. LinkedIn</strong>
                        <p>The first app you need is LinkedIn for job and business news. It is the most effective platform for getting or landing a good-paying job, aside from being the world's biggest professional network.</p>
                        <p>Its founders aim to create opportunities for every member of its global workforce. The app helps you build your presence while you network with colleagues in your industry, reach out to recruiters, or vice versa.</p>
                        <p>Unarguably, the LinkedIn platform has been an advantage to the professional world in the 21st century, having about 1 billion users in over 200 countries and territories, according to LinkedIn.com.</p>
                        <p>To start, download the app or go to the LinkedIn sign-up page, input your name and email address, and that's it.</p>

                        <strong>2. Clockify</strong>
                        <p>Clockify is a free online time tracking software. It allows the user to monitor and manage time on projects when the timer is turned on from your start time.</p>
                        <p>With the inclusion of a timesheet, timers, worksheet, and calendar, it makes the software seamless and effective.</p>
                        <p>The timesheet allows you to balance the workload on different projects. It also helps enhance effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>Navigating Clockify is easy as it can be installed on mobile devices and desktops. To sign up, you just need an email address and you're in.</p>

                        <strong>3. Trello</strong>
                         <p>Trello is a project management tool that is used for collaborating, mostly with a team. It can be utilized to organize and keep track of projects.</p>
                        <p>With this software, information about your work and whether it is making advancement or not can be accessed.</p>
                        <p>Interestingly, the user-friendly app makes it easy for team members as you can add comments, deadlines, and even attachments.</p>
                        <p>Trello can be accessed on both mobile and desktop devices.</p>
                        <p>Trello can be said to be free even with a premium subscription option because almost all of its features can be accessed from the free version.</p>

                        <strong>4. Google Drive</strong>
                        <p>Another important app to have as a freelancer is Google Drive. This is a cloud storage provider that backs up your files outside your system but on a Google server with its 15GB storage space.</p>
                        <p>It allows you to access any file in any country of the world, with just an internet connection. Google Drive makes it easy to share and work on files with colleagues by just sending a link.</p>
                        <p>An additional feature that makes this app interesting is its search function that makes it effortless when searching for a file, even with the tiniest information. It can be navigated on mobile devices and desktops.</p>
                        
                        <strong>5. PayPal</strong>
                        <p>PayPal is a quick and easy fintech app that allows you to send and receive money after signing up with just an email address.</p>
                        <p>After signing up, you have the option of choosing either a personal or business account to provide the best services to its users. Binding and linking your credit or debit cards finalizes your PayPal journey. This reveals how user-friendly the digital wallet is.</p>
